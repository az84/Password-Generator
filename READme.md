## Introduction:

For this project we are required to modify the starter code to create an application that would enable people to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It should have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.
